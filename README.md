#sdev2730-final2

My final project for Software Development 2730 at Davis Technical College.

An app where city council leaders can propose any changes that they want to make to their city, or maybe even their citizens could propose changes as well.

This app was created using React Native and Expo. See the link for how to use React native to build mobile apps.
